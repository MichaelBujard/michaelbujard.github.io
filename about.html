    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I specialize in turning messy data into structured, reliable information that helps 
      businesses streamline workflows, reduce errors, and gain actionable insights. With a 
      background in data transformation and workflow optimization, I work with individuals 
      and organizations to make their data more efficient, accurate, and automation-ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey started with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of 
      Dallas, where I developed both technical expertise and a problem-solving mindset. Since then, 
      I’ve worked with business data, automation, and e-commerce operations, ensuring that product 
      information and other datasets are structured for usability and business insights.
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience spans data transformation, workflow improvement, and process optimization, 
      with a strong focus on preparing data for future automation. Whether you need help 
      standardizing raw datasets, optimizing business processes, or ensuring data integrity, 
      I provide practical solutions to keep your operations running efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy keeping up with trends in science, technology, and engineering, 
      having meaningful conversations, and playing rugby.
